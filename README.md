hi! i’m anne :-)
      
      a student from singapore, studying at ngee ann polytechnic's 
      engineering science course, specialising in automation and 
      mechatronic systems. 
      
      i am also currently a project intern at defence science and technology 
      agency (DSTA)'s land systems programme centre

*･ﾟ✧ interests 

      machine learning and computer science peak my curiosity and interest, 
      although i am still new to it and trying to get a grasp of it!
      
      i am also interested in robotics - the current project i am working on 
      entails using dji's robomaster ep, and i plan to soon invest in a 
      ✧ raspberry pi ✧ (yum)
      
      i have recently also been trying my hand at ui/ux development, and am 
      interested in graphic design - something i often do for my 
      co-curriculars in school :)
